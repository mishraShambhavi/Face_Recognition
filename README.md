# Face_Recognition
In today's digital era, face recognition technology plays a vital role in various applications such as security systems, personal identification, and smart devices. This project aims to develop a face recognition system using the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for face identification.
